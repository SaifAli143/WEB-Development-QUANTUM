        The Bata Group is a family-owned business, making it possible to provide customers around the world with the best shoes at the best prices, backed by unparalleled service, for over 125 years.

        We live the Bata way by improving the life of each community in which we operate. This means supporting our consumers, teams and the community itself, as well as providing opportunities for personal and professional growth.

        Our passion is shoes
        We love making stand-out footwear our customers can wear to look good and feel good all day long, and always with price tags that impress them too.

        Our brands and business
        We are organized into three business units: Bata, Bata Industrials (safety shoes) and AW Lab (sports style).

        We have a portfolio company with more than 20 brands and labels, such as Bata, North Star, Power, Bubblegummers, Weinbrenner, Sandak or Toughees.
